# Flask-Based-Post
This project is a Flask-based web application that utilizes Bootstrap for a visually appealing and responsive user interface, allowing users to view blog posts, learn about the author, and get in touch via a contact form with email integration.

# What I have learned
Through this project, I developed a Flask web application using Bootstrap for a sleek and responsive user interface. With Flask, I built different routes to handle various pages such as the main page, about page, individual blog posts, and a contact page. By incorporating Jinja templating engine, I was able to dynamically render HTML templates and display the retrieved blog posts from an external API.

To enhance the user experience, I utilized Bootstrap's CSS framework, which provided me with pre-designed components and responsive layouts. This allowed me to create visually appealing pages that adapt well to different screen sizes and devices. I also leveraged Bootstrap's FontAwesome icons to enhance the visual aesthetics of the application.

The contact page allowed users to get in touch with me by submitting a form. I handled form submissions using Flask's request object and integrated email functionality using the smtplib library. This enabled me to send emails to a designated recipient with the submitted contact information.

Throughout this project, I gained valuable skills in Flask web development, routing and URL handling, HTML templating with Jinja, making HTTP requests, handling form submissions, and integrating email functionality.

This project showcases my ability to combine different technologies to build a robust and interactive web application. The source code for this project can be found on my GitHub repository, demonstrating my practical experience and proficiency in web development using Flask, Bootstrap, and related technologies.
